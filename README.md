        *   User Registration & Login endpoints.
        *   Authentication: Implement JWT authentication.
        *   Permissions: Users can only manage their own to-do items.
        *   Rate Limiting: Apply rate limits to API endpoints.

        *   Cloud-based solutions: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager.Here's the complete Django backend development roadmap with all debug print statements removed:

## Comprehensive Django Backend Development Roadmap

**7. Security & Best Practices**
   *   **Security Tools & Audits:**
        *   Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools like `Bandit`.
        *   Django-specific tools like `django-secure` (though many of its features are now in Django core, it's good to be aware of the historical context and purpose).
   *   **Exercise:** Perform a mini security audit on one of your existing Django applications.
        *   Use `Bandit` to scan your code for common vulnerabilities.
        *   Review Django's security checklist and apply relevant settings.
        *   Attempt to identify and patch any potential XSS, CSRF, or other vulnerabilities you might find.
        *   Ensure secrets are not hardcoded.

**8. Deployment & DevOps**
   *   **Containerization (Docker):**
        *   Writing `Dockerfile`s for Django applications and related services (e.g., Postgres).
        *   Using `docker-compose` for local development environments and multi-container setups.
   *   **WSGI vs ASGI Servers:**
        *   Understanding the role of application servers.
        *   WSGI servers: Gunicorn, uWSGI (for synchronous Django).
        *   ASGI servers: Daphne, Uvicorn (for asynchronous Django, including Channels).
   *   **Reverse Proxy & HTTPS:**
        *   Using Nginx or Caddy as a reverse proxy.
        *   Serving static files and media through the reverse proxy.

        *   Automating the deployment process after tests pass.
        *   Integrating with CI tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for deployments.
   *   **Exercise:** Dockerize one of your Django projects (e.g., the blog or To-Do API).
        *   Create a `Dockerfile` for the Django app.
        *   Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to run your app with a PostgreSQL database.
        *   Deploy this containerized application to a free-tier cloud hosting service (e.g., Heroku with Docker deployment, Railway, Fly.io, or a small VPS).
        *   Set up a simple CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy changes from your Git repository.

**9. Performance & Monitoring**

        *   Write a simple load test script using Locust or k6.
        *   Run the test against your deployed API.
        *   Use tools like Django Debug Toolbar (if testing locally/staging) or Sentry/APM to identify bottlenecks during the load test.

**What's next?**
1.  **Pick a Capstone Project:** Choose a project idea that genuinely excites you and is slightly more complex than the exercises (e.g., a simplified e-commerce platform, a social media feed clone, an IoT data dashboard, a subscription management service). Apply the layers from this roadmap as you build it out.
2.  **Schedule Weekly Deep Dives:** Dedicate specific time each week to focus intensely on one new tool, concept, or library mentioned in this roadmap (e.g., one week on DRF permissions, another on Docker networking, another on Celery task design).
3.  **Engage with the Django Community:**
    *   Read official Django documentation and DRF documentation – they are excellent.
    *   Follow Django-related blogs and news.
    *   Watch talks from DjangoCon and other relevant conferences.
    *   Participate in forums: Django Forum, Stack Overflow (for asking and answering questions), Reddit (r/django).
    *   Join community chats: Django Discord server, IRC (#django on Libera.Chat).

4.  **Build a Portfolio:** Showcase your projects on GitHub. A good portfolio is crucial for job hunting.

Regarding your question, Ali: "*Do you have a domain preference (e-commerce, fintech, social apps) or deployment target (like AWS vs on-prem) so we can tailor your path even tighter?*"

As your coder, I'm here to build based on your product vision. If you, Ali the Product Manager, have a specific domain (like e-commerce, fintech, social media, healthcare, etc.) or a preferred deployment environment (e.g., a strong focus on AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or on-premises solutions), let me know! We can then emphasize certain tools, patterns, or compliance considerations relevant to that specific area. For now, this roadmap is comprehensive and general-purpose, designed to make you a versatile and rock-solid Django backend developer.
